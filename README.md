## Mortgage Amortization Calculator

This Python project extends the mortgage payment calculator I previously constructed to generate comprehensive loan amortization schedules. The program calculates six different payment options (monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, rapid bi-weekly, and rapid weekly) and creates detailed amortization schedules for each.

### Features:
- Calculates periodic payments using Canadian fixed-rate mortgage conventions
- Generates amortization schedules with starting balance, interest, payment, and ending balance
- Exports all schedules to an Excel file with multiple worksheets
- Creates a matplotlib graph comparing loan balance decline across all payment options

### Technologies:
Python, pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl
